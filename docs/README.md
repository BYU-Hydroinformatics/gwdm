Groundwater Data Mapper (GWDM)

The Groundwater Data Mapper (GWDM) is a Tethys web application that allows users to visualize and analyze groundwater data. The application is designed to be used by groundwater professionals, researchers, and decision-makers to explore groundwater data and make informed decisions about groundwater management. The application provides tools for visualizing groundwater data, analyzing trends, and creating custom maps and charts. The application is built on the Tethys Platform, which is an open-source web application development platform for geospatial data.

The GWDM was developed in the Hydroinformatics Laboratory at Brigham Young University under the direction of Dr. Norm Jones (njones@byu.edu).
