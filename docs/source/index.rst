**INTRODUCTION**
===========
Water managers in Western Africa and around the world face the daunting task of managing freshwater resources in the face of increased demand from industry, agriculture, climate change, and population growth. As surface water resources become fully allocated, groundwater is increasingly targeted to make up surface water deficits, particularly during periods of drought. As a result, many of our aquifers are not being managed in a sustainable fashion, resulting in reduced water quality, land subsidence, increased pumping costs, and in some cases, the complete exhaustion of an aquifer and the loss of groundwater as a buffer during times of drought.
