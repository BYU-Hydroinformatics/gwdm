**DATA PREPARATION SCRIPTS**
========

These scripts can aid in the data preparation process required prior to using the GWDM tool. They have all been created in a cloud-based environment called Google Colaboratory, or Colab for short. Colab is built on Jupyter Notebook, which allows users to write, execute, and visualize Python code quickly and easily.

These notebooks have been shared as Github Gists. A gist allows the notebook to be opened, run, and modified by an individual user without affecting the experience of another user.

There is a tool for retrieving elevations at wells that are missing ground surface elevation measurements, a tool for assigning aquifer IDs and names to wells depending on location, a tool for formatting wells and time series files, a tool for retrieving wells and time series files from the USGS NWIS database (U.S. only), and a tool for creating "representative" wells based on a grid.

An example set of files has been provided; however, you are welcome to use your own files if you would prefer.
